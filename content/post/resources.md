The “Open Mind” neural communications consortium was formed to accelerate cooperation and innovation in the use of implantable neurostimulation hardware platforms. These next generation devices incorporate sensing of cortical and subcortical field potential activity, with the capability for wireless streaming from the internal device to external computers over years. Our founding team represents the major clinical areas of interest in neuromodulation: movement disorders (UCSF), epilepsy (Mayo Clinic), and psychiatry (Brown/Baylor), and includes experts in the design and dissemination of implantable devices (Oxford), and in neuroethics. This consortium will facilitate already funded proposals, as well as entry of new investigators, in the rapidly evolving ecosystem of implantable wireless neural interfaces.

Our goal is to provide investigators with critical elements to the launch of their own clinical studies: A “turnkey” user interface to get started, a library of more sophisticated, open source software elements for neural sensing at home paired with peripheral monitors, and streamlined regulatory pathway for FDA approval of investigational protocols, which we call the “Open Source Quality Management System”. We will disseminate education and resources through biannual workshops and a web-based library of regulatory documents, software, and the Quality Management System*.
